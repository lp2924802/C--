Version History Summary - Continued from Project 1

V2.2: Scorecard formatting cleaned/reduced and program modularized more in this version.

V2.3: Continued cleaning of scorecard formatting and program modularization. Working to reduce repeated text in code and replace with loops.

V2.3.1: Continued modularization and debugging of initial program to accommodate newly added arrays.

V2.3.2: Progressed from V2.3.1 to V2.3.2 so I can revert back to previous version (V2.3.1) if the following changes somehow irrevocably mess up the program. Finishing transition to arrays. Small bugs introduced into program in last version upon switching to arrays, so debugging those is another goal of this version.

V2.3.3: Working on fixing bug where player turns alternate back and forth between 1 and 2 in an infinite loop, never ending the turn or prompting the player to place their score in some category. Will also be checking to see if there are any variables or constants that aren't being used and will remove any that might be found. Starting to write scorecard arrays.

V2.4: All bugs caused by transition to arrays have now been resolved.Program is now able to correctly calculate dice roll scores for the "Upper" Section. Next steps are figuring out how to print scores onto the scorecard and developing the logic for the "Lower" Section scoring.

V2.4.1/V2.4.2: Working on integrating printing to scorecard.

V2.4.3: All spaces in scorecard able to be printed onto upper section scores correctly. Modularization has been going well, although the program itself is still fairly long.

V2.5/V2.5.1: Cleaning up number display on scorecard. Resolving bugs in the Yahtzee checker and the while !all gameplay loop. Beginning work on lower section logic.

V2.5.2: Bugs being worked out in scorecard display system. Lower section logic being finalized.

V2.6: "Lower" section logic all coded. Yahtzee Bonus logic still needs to be fully worked out. Totals and subtotals have not been programmed yet.

V2.6.1: Working on getting game totals now. Progressively smoothing out any bugs that are found. Completely rewriting the index selection and section scoring functions in an attempt to fix a bug where attempting to write a score to the full house section completely crashes the game. Getting very close to having a fully complete Yahtzee game.

V2.6.2: Game is complete! Further additions/alterations might be done in the future to improve the playability and aesthetics, but otherwise it is a fully functional Yahtzee game with effective error handling, an accurate scoring system, and consistent gameplay logic.
